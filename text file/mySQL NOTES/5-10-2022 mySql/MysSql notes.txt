                   //first colmn          //second colmn               //third colmn

for showing the all tables 
->show tables;
desc [tb_name];
->eg: desc user;
for dropping the table 
-> drop table[table_name];
for renamming the table
-> alter table user rename to student;
for removing the data from the table
->truncate table student;


inserting the data in table.
->insert into [table_name](id,name,city) value(12,'durgesh','delhi');
when you do not want to change the order

if want to see whole table.

select*from student;

how to update table.

1. adding colmn in table

alter table[table_name] add col1;
eg -> alter table student add country varchar(50);

how to update whole colmn

how to specific row in colmn
 update [table_name] set col='value' where col = 'value',col ='value';
-> update student set country ='india' where name='kunal';

if you want to delete perticuler row 
delete from [table_name] where col=value;
->delete from student where id =12;


clause in mySQL;

where:
eg 

select*from student where city='bhopal';

as: you can show the colmn name with diffrent attribute 
eg select name as "USERNAME" ,city as "CITYNAME" from student;

->select SUM(id) from student;
-> select sum(id) as "total salary" from student;

AVG function
-> select AVG(id) as "Avarage salary" from student;

COUNT function
->select COUNT(*) as "total rows" from student;
-select COUNT(id) as "total rows" from student;

MIN function
-> select MIN(id) as "minimum salaray" from student;
-> select * from student where id=( select MIN(id) as "minimum salary" from student );
-> select name from student where id=(select MIN(id) from student);

MAX function
-> selct MAX(id) as "maximum salary" from student;
-> select * from student where id = (select  MAX(id) from student);

Foreign key and joins
->create table laptops(lid int primary key, lmodel varchar(200) , studentId int, foreign key(studentID) references student(id));
-> insert into laptops value(13414,'HP', 1);
->insert into laptops value(232232,'DELL',22);
-> select student.name, student.city , laptops.lmodel from student , laptops where student.id=laptops.studentId;
